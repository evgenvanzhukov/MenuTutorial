# MenuTutorial

Simple tutorial from swift book how add menu at project.

In this tutorial i had a problem with rendering initial view. 
After watching educational video, i tried to do all from my head. When Initial View didn't show, i copied all code from original project, 
and it still didn't works. I downloaded original project from link at video, and it worked.

The reason of my trouble was in project settings. Original project was builded for iOS 12.1. My project as default was builded for iOS 14.4. 
After fixing problems - it worked.
